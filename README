This is fsw, a program which uses the File System Events API of the Apple Mac
OS X operating system to receive notification when the contents of the specified
files or directories are modified.

Installation
============

See the INSTALL file for detailed information about how to configure and install
fsw.

  fsw is a C++ program and a C++ compiler compliant with the C++11 standard is
required to compile it.  A complete C/C++ toolchain for OS X is provided with
Apple XCode, which can freely installed from the Apple App Store.

  No other software packages or dependencies are required to configure and
install fsw.

Usage
=====

fsw accepts a list of paths for which change events should be received:

  $ fsw [options] ... path0 ... pathn

The event stream is created even if any of the paths do not exist yet.  If they
are created after fsw is launched, change events will be properly received.
This behaviour is possible thanks to the File System Events API.

  For more information, refer to the fsw man page.

Bug Reports
===========

Bug reports can be sent directly to the authors.
