This is fsw, a program which receives notifications when the contents of the
specified files or directories are modified.  fsw implements two kind of
watcher:

  * A watcher based on the File System Events API of Apple OS X.
  * A watcher based on kqueue.

  As a consequence, fsw should build and work correctly on any system shipping
either of the aforementioned APIs.

Installation
============

See the INSTALL file for detailed information about how to configure and install
fsw.

  fsw is a C++ program and a C++ compiler compliant with the C++11 standard is
required to compile it.  A complete C/C++ toolchain for OS X is provided with
Apple XCode, which can freely installed from the Apple App Store.

  No other software packages or dependencies are required to configure and
install fsw but the aforementioned APIs used by the file system watchers.

Usage
=====

fsw accepts a list of paths for which change events should be received:

  $ fsw [options] ... path-0 ... path-n

The event stream is created even if any of the paths do not exist yet.  If they
are created after fsw is launched, change events will be properly received.
Depending on the wathcher being used, newly created paths will be monitored
after the amount of configured latency has elapsed.

  For more information, refer to the fsw man page.

Bug Reports
===========

Bug reports can be sent directly to the authors.
