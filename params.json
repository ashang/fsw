{"name":"Fsw","tagline":"A file change monitor with multiple backends: Apple OS X File System Events API, *BSD kqueue, Linux inotify and a stat-based backend.","body":"fsw is a file change monitor that receives notifications when the contents of\r\nthe specified files or directories are modified.  fsw implements four kinds of\r\nmonitors:\r\n\r\n  * A monitor based on the _File System Events API_ of Apple OS X.\r\n  * A monitor based on _kqueue_, an event notification interface introduced in\r\n    FreeBSD 4.1 and supported on most *BSD systems (including OS X).\r\n  * A monitor based on _inotify_, a Linux kernel subsystem that reports file\r\n    system changes to applications.\r\n  * A monitor which periodically stats the file system, saves file modification\r\n    times in memory and manually calculates file system changes, which can work\r\n    on any operating system where `stat` (2) can be used.\r\n\r\nfsw should build and work correctly on any system shipping either of the\r\naforementioned APIs.\r\n\r\nGetting fsw\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThe recommended way to get the sources of fsw in order to build it on your\r\nsystem is getting a release tarball.  A release tarball contains everything a \r\nuser needs to build fsw on his system, following the instructions detailed in\r\nthe Installation section below and the INSTALL file.\r\n\r\n  Getting a copy of the source repository is not recommended, unless you are a\r\ndeveloper, you have the GNU Build System installed on your machine and you know\r\nhow to boostrap it on the sources.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nSee the `INSTALL` file for detailed information about how to configure and\r\ninstall fsw.\r\n\r\n  fsw is a C++ program and a C++ compiler compliant with the C++11 standard is\r\nrequired to build it.  A complete C/C++ toolchain for OS X is provided with\r\nApple XCode, which can freely installed from the Apple App Store.\r\n\r\n  No other software packages or dependencies are required to configure and\r\ninstall fsw but the aforementioned APIs used by the file system monitors.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nfsw accepts a list of paths for which change events should be received:\r\n\r\n    $ fsw [options] ... path-0 ... path-n\r\n\r\nThe event stream is created even if any of the paths do not exist yet.  If they\r\nare created after fsw is launched, change events will be properly received.\r\nDepending on the wathcher being used, newly created paths will be monitored\r\nafter the amount of configured latency has elapsed.\r\n\r\n  For more information, refer to the fsw man page.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2014 Enrico M.
