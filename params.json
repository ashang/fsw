{"name":"Fsw","tagline":"A file change monitor that can use either the File System Events API of Apple OS X or the kqueue interface of *BSD systems.","body":"fsw is a program that receives notifications when the contents of the specified files or directories are modified.  fsw implements three kind of watchers:\r\n\r\n  * A watcher based on the _File System Events API_ of Apple OS X.\r\n  * A watcher based on _kqueue_, an event notification interface introduced in\r\n    FreeBSD 4.1 and supported on most *BSD systems (including OS X).\r\n  * A watcher which periodically stats the file system, saves file modification\r\n    times in memory and manually calculates file system changes.\r\n\r\nfsw should build and work correctly on any system shipping either of the\r\naforementioned APIs.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nSee the INSTALL file for detailed information about how to configure and install\r\nfsw.\r\n\r\n  fsw is a C++ program and a C++ compiler compliant with the C++11 standard is\r\nrequired to compile it.  A complete C/C++ toolchain for OS X is provided with\r\nApple XCode, which can freely installed from the Apple App Store.\r\n\r\n  No other software packages or dependencies are required to configure and\r\ninstall fsw but the aforementioned APIs used by the file system watchers.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nfsw accepts a list of paths for which change events should be received:\r\n\r\n    $ fsw [options] ... path-0 ... path-n\r\n\r\nThe event stream is created even if any of the paths do not exist yet.  If they\r\nare created after fsw is launched, change events will be properly received.\r\nDepending on the wathcher being used, newly created paths will be monitored\r\nafter the amount of configured latency has elapsed.\r\n\r\n  For more information, refer to the fsw man page.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2014 Enrico M.
