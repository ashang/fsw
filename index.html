        <p>fsw is a program that receives notifications when the contents of the specified files or directories are modified.  fsw implements three kind of watchers:</p>

<ul>
<li>A watcher based on the <em>File System Events API</em> of Apple OS X.</li>
<li>A watcher based on <em>kqueue</em>, an event notification interface introduced in
FreeBSD 4.1 and supported on most *BSD systems (including OS X).</li>
<li>A watcher which periodically stats the file system, saves file modification
times in memory and manually calculates file system changes.</li>
</ul><p>fsw should build and work correctly on any system shipping either of the
aforementioned APIs.</p>

<h2>
<a name="limitations" class="anchor" href="#limitations"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Limitations</h2>

<p>The limitations of fsw depend largely on the watcher being used:</p>

<ul>
<li>The FSEvents watcher, available only on Apple OS X, has no known limitations
and scales very well with the number of files being observed.</li>
<li>The kqueue watcher, available on any *BSD system featuring kqueue, requires
a file descriptor to be opened for every file being watched.  As a result,
this watcher scales badly with the number of files being observed and may
begin to misbehave as soon as the fsw process runs out of file descriptors.
In this case, fsw dumps one error on standard error for every file that
cannot be opened.</li>
<li>The poll watcher, available on any platform, only relies on available CPU
and memory to perform its task.  The performance of this watcher degrades
linearly with the number of files being watched.<br>
</li>
</ul><p>Usage recommendations are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>On OS X, use only the FSEvents watcher.</li>
<li>If the number of files to observe is sufficiently small, use the kqueue
watcher.  Beware that on some systems the maximum number of file descriptors
that can be opened by a process is set to a very low value (values as low
as 256 are not uncommon), even if the operating system may allow a much
larger value.  In this case, check your OS documentation to raise this limit
on either a per process or a system-wide basis.</li>
<li>If feasible, watch directories instead of watching files.</li>
<li>If none of the above applies, use the poll watcher.  The authors' experience
indicates that fsw requires approximately 600 MB or RAM memory to observe a
hierarchy of 500.000 files if std::hash is defined in  otherwise
it requires approximately 1300 MB.  A common bottleneck of the poll watcher
is disk access, since stat()-ing a huge number of files may take a huge
amount of time.  In this case, the latency should be set to a sufficiently
large value in order to reduce the performance degradation that may result
from fsw's frequent disk access.</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<p>See the INSTALL file for detailed information about how to configure and install
fsw.</p>

<p>fsw is a C++ program and a C++ compiler compliant with the C++11 standard is
required to compile it.  A complete C/C++ toolchain for OS X is provided with
Apple XCode, which can freely installed from the Apple App Store.</p>

<p>No other software packages or dependencies are required to configure and
install fsw but the aforementioned APIs used by the file system watchers.</p>

<h1>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h1>

<p>fsw accepts a list of paths for which change events should be received:</p>

<pre><code>$ fsw [options] ... path-0 ... path-n
</code></pre>

<p>The event stream is created even if any of the paths do not exist yet.  If they
are created after fsw is launched, change events will be properly received.
Depending on the wathcher being used, newly created paths will be monitored
after the amount of configured latency has elapsed.</p>

<p>For more information, refer to the fsw man page.</p>
