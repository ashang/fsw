        <p>fsw is a program that receives notifications when the contents of the specified files or directories are modified.  fsw implements three kind of watchers:</p>

<ul>
<li>A watcher based on the <em>File System Events API</em> of Apple OS X.</li>
<li>A watcher based on <em>kqueue</em>, an event notification interface introduced in
FreeBSD 4.1 and supported on most *BSD systems (including OS X).</li>
<li>A watcher which periodically stats the file system, saves file modification
times in memory and manually calculates file system changes.</li>
</ul><p>fsw should build and work correctly on any system shipping either of the
aforementioned APIs.</p>

<h2>
<a name="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<p>See the INSTALL file for detailed information about how to configure and install
fsw.</p>

<p>fsw is a C++ program and a C++ compiler compliant with the C++11 standard is
required to build it.  A complete C/C++ toolchain for OS X is provided with
Apple XCode, which can freely installed from the Apple App Store.</p>

<p>No other software packages or dependencies are required to configure and
install fsw but the aforementioned APIs used by the file system watchers.</p>

<h2>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p>fsw accepts a list of paths for which change events should be received:</p>

<pre><code>$ fsw [options] ... path-0 ... path-n
</code></pre>

<p>The event stream is created even if any of the paths do not exist yet.  If they
are created after fsw is launched, change events will be properly received.
Depending on the wathcher being used, newly created paths will be monitored
after the amount of configured latency has elapsed.</p>

<p>For more information, refer to the fsw man page.</p>
