New in 1.4.0:

  * New inotify-based monitor added.
  * Add -o/--one-per-batch option to print a single message with the number of
    change events in the current batch.
  * fswatch-run scripts are provided for ZSH and Bash.
  * System is scanned during installation to check for ZSH and Bash
    availability.  Path of found shells is substituted in the corresponding
    scripts, otherwise the default /bin/[shell] is used.
  * If a supported shell is found, the fswatch-run symbolic link is created in
    the installation directory to the corresponding script.  The lookup order
    of the shells is:
    - ZSH.
    - Bash.
  * Remove usages of C++11 initializer lists so that fswatch builds with older
    compiler.

New in 1.3.1:

  * No features were added.
  * Some bugs were fixed.
  * README.* files are now installed.
  * fsw builds and works correctly on linux (poll monitor only).

New in 1.3.0:

  * fsw compiles even if regcomp and <regcomp.h> are not available.
  * The ASCII NUL character (\0) can be used as a line separator in order to
    properly parse the output with programs such as xargs and read.
  * Remove the requirement of having either either CoreServices or sys/event.h
    for fsw to compile.
  * fsw only prints event flags when required so with the -x/--event-flags
    option.  The -n/--numeric option implicitly turns on this option.
  * fsw follows symbolic links with the -L/--follow-links option.

New in 1.2.2:

  * Paths can be excluded using -e/--exclude and providing a set of regular
    expressions.
