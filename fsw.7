.Sh NAME
.Nm fsw
.Nd Ask for notification when the contents of the specified files or directory
hierarchies are modified.

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm fsw
.Op Fl hknprtuv
.Op Fl f Ar format-time
.Op Fl l Ar latency

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
command receives notifications when the contents of the specified files or
directories are modified.
fsw implements three kind of
watcher:
.Bl -tag -width indent

.It -
A watcher based on the File System Events API of Apple OS X.

.It -
A watcher based on kqueue, an event notification interface introduces in
FreeBSD 4.1 and supported on most *BSD systems (including OS X).

.It -
A watcher which periodically stats the file system, saves file modification
times in memory and manually calculates changes.

.El

.Nm
writes a record for each event it receives containing:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It -
The timestamp when the event was
.Em received
(optionally).

.It -
The path affected by the current event.
.It -
A space-separated list of
.Em event types
(see 
.Sx EVENT TYPES
).
.El

.Pp
.Nm
enters an infinite loop and never returns.
When it receives a SIGABRT, SIGINT or SIGTERM signal,
.Nm
closes the notification streams and exits gracefully returning 0 to the calling
process.

.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent

.It Fl f, -format-time Ar format
Print the event time using the specified
.Ar format .
Supported formats are specified by
.Sy strftime (3) .

.It Fl h
Show the help message.

.It Fl k
Use the kqueue watcher.
This option is only available when more than one watcher is available, and one
of them is the kqueue watcher.

.It Fl l Ar latency
Set the
.Ar latency 
in seconds.
The latency is a double value greater than 0.1.
Smaller values are currently not allowed in order not to compromise the
performance of the system.
The default latency is 1 second.

.It Fl n
Print the numeric value of the event flag, instead of the array of symbolic
names.
The numeric value of the event flags are system-specific and may vary across
different versions of OS X.
As a consequence, the use of numeric values is discouraged. 

.It Fl p
Use the poll-based watcher.
This watcher periodically stats the file system to detect changes on the
observed paths.
The time required by this watcher linearly increases with the number of files to
watch.
This watcher should be considered a last resource in case other watchers cannot
be used.  
 
.It Fl r
Watch subdirectories recursively.  This option may not be supported on all
systems.

.It Fl t
Print the event timestamp.

.It Fl u, -utf-time
Print the event time in UTC format.
When this option is not specified, the time is printed using the system
.Em
local
time, as defined by
.Sy localtime (3) .

.It Fl v
Print verbose output.

.El

.Sh EXAMPLES
The following command listens for changes in the current directory and events
are delivered every 5 seconds:
.Pp
.Dl "$ fsw -l 5 ."
.Pp 
The following command listens for changes in the current user home directory and
/var/log:
.Pp
.Dl "$ fsw ~ /var/log"

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
This utility can be built on Apple OS X v. 10.6 or greater.

.Sh BUGS
No bugs are known.
